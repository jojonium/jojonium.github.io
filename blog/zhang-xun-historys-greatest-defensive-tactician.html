      <h1 class="title">Zhang Xun: History's Greatest Defensive Tactician</h1>

      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Xun_(Tang_dynasty)">Zhang
        Xun</a> was a Chinese general during the Tang Dynasty, and one of my
        favorite historical figures. He used brilliant tactics to successfully
        defend two fortresses against overwhelming enemy strength, displaying
        extreme loyalty to his dynasty and protecting the southern China from
        being conquered by Yan rebels practically single-handedly. Although he
        resorted to some unfortunate strategies, such as condoning mass
        cannibalism, Zhang is still a fascinating figure with a life story that
        reads like a movie script.

      <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

      <p>
        The Tang Dynasty was a powerful empire that ruled China from 618 to 907,
        often regarded as a golden age in Chinese history. The first half of the
        dynasty's reign was a period of stability and relative peace.
        Unfortunately, this stability ended in 755 when a Tang general named An
        Lushan declared himself emperor of northern China, establishing a rival
        dynasty known as Yan.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first the Yan made quick gains in conquering China. An Lushan treated
        captured Tang generals and officials well, leading more and more of them
        to rebel and join his side.
