      <h1 class="title">How to climb Mount Fuji</h1>

      <p>
        Last week, after spending a day at <a href="fuji-q-highland-proof-that-you-can-make-a-theme-park-out-of-anything">Fuji-Q
        Highland</a>, I set out with a group of three other students to climb
        to the highest point in Japan, the summit of Mount Fuji.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Fujisan</i> (富士山) is a 3,776 meter tall active stratovolcano
        within sight of Tokyo on a clear day. Its cone is remarkably
        symmetrical, and it stands alone in a mostly flat plain away from other
        mountain ranges. For these reasons, it has been a subject of Japanese
        art for hundreds of years.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are two main routes up the mountain, the Yoshida and Subashiri
        trail. Both are only open for two months out of the year, from early
        July to early September. Because of this, the mountain tends to be very
        crowded with Japanese climbers and foreign visitors. To avoid these
        crowds, we decided to climb at the end of climbing season (actually the
        last days possible, September 9 and 10), and take the slightly longer
        and steeper trail, Subashiri.
      </p>

      <p>
        Luck also seemed to be on our side, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Pacific_typhoon_season#Typhoon_Faxai">Typhoon Faxai</a>,
        the strongest storm to hit Japan in 60 years, blew through the area the
        night of September 8. While is made our time at Fuji-Q a little wet, it
        had already passed by the time we started climbing on the 9th. The storm
        apparently scared away other hikers, because we practically had the
        mountain to ourselves the first day.
      </p>

        Although the official trailhead is much lower, you can take a bus to
        Subashiri Trail 5th Station at 2,000 meters. This is what we chose to
        do, and I'd recommend it unless you want to walk through miles of boring
        forest before even really starting the ascent.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a long bus ride from out Airbnb, we reached the 5th Station around
        noon on September 9th. The trail starts out as wide stone steps through
        the forest but quickly becomes a dirt path.
      </p>

      <p>
        As we progressed up the mountain the trees began to thin and the soil
        started to get darker and more volcanic. The trail thus far was pretty
        easy, just a gentle dirt slope shaded by trees.

      <p>
        At about 2300 meters we broke through the treeline into a vast expanse
        of dirt and grass, with clouds periodically obscuring our view.
