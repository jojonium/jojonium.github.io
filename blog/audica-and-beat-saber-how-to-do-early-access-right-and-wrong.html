        <i>Audica</i> and <i>Beat Saber</i>: how to do early access right and
        wrong
      </h1>

      <p>
        Very rarely do you get such a perfect case study handed to you as with
        <i>Audica</i> and <i>Beat Saber</i>. Both are early access VR rhythm
        games on Steam and Oculus, both involve hitting red and blue notes with
        the correctly-colored weapon carried in each of you hands, and both are
        damn good fun. Let's take a look at how <i>Audica</i> takes advantage of
        early access to push content to early adopters while <i>Beat Saber</i>
        takes advantage of early access to take advantage of users.

        First, there was <i>Beat Saber</i>
      </h2>

      <p>
        In May 2018, <i>Beat Saber</i> was released into early access on Steam and
        the Oculus Store. Before this, there really weren't any good VR rhythm
        games, and certainly none as flashy and fun as this. It had fancy visuals
        and great intuitive gameplay that blended <i>Dance Dance Revolution</i>
        with <i>Fruit Ninja</i>, and was an immediate hit. Within a week it was
        the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/vr-rhythm-game-beat-saber-now-the-highest-rated-game-on-steam-releasing-level-editor-next-week/">
        highest-rated game on Steam</a>. It launched with a tracklist of ten
        songs, and promises of much more.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was a lot of talk and a lot of hype at the time, and this is when
        I first started playing <i>Beat Saber</i>. And admittedly, it's a lot of
        fun.
