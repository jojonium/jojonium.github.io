      <h1 class="title">Adventures in system administration - Part 1</h1>

      <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

      <p>
        For the past year or so I've been running a bunch of services off of two
        servers in my apartment. These include several simple websites
        (including this one) served by Nginx, a Plex server, a few different
        game servers, and Transmission-daemon behind a VPN. This worked fine for
        a while, but as my desire to host more things myself grew, the two old
        HP desktops I had been using couldn't keep up. In May 2019 I decided to
        upgrade.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the first in what I assume will be a long series of blog posts
        describing in detail the process I used to set up my own network of
        virtual servers to handle the tasks I want automated for my personal
        life. The goal is both as documentation for my own purposes, and as a
        guide so others can do the same thing.
      </p>

      <h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

      <p>
        I bought a used Dell PowerEdge R710 2U rack server based on online
        recommendations, with 32 GB of RAM and two Intel Xeon E5620 CPUs. The
        RAID controller it came with could only handle drives up to 2 TB, so I
        swapped it out with a PERC H700. I also bought two 1 TB hard drives to
        use in a RAID 1 array for important OS data, and an 8 TB drive for low
        priority storage. I plan to buy more 8 TB hard drives for expanded
        storage and backups, but this will do for now.
      </p>

      <h3 id="software">Software</h3>

      <p>
        I'll be using <a href="https://www.centos.org/">CentOS 7</a> for both
        host and guest operating systems. This is because it's based on Red Hat
        Enterprise Linux, which has wide support in a lot of server-based
        applications, and also because my prior experience with Ubuntu server
        left me feeling annoyed.
      </p>

      <p>
        For virtualization technology I'm using KVM/QEMU. I tried using
        Spacewalk/Cobbler for system provisioning, but couldn't quite get it set
        up right, so I switched to
        <a href="https://www.theforeman.org/">Foreman</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        With that out of the way, let's get right into setting it up.
      </p>

      <h2 id="step-1-setting-up-the-host">Step 1: Setting up the host</h2>

      <p>
        The first step is obviously to install the operating system, so head
        over to <a href="https://www.centos.org/download/">centos.org</a> and
        grab an ISO. I went for the minimal version because I don't need a GUI.
        That install is pretty straightforward, so the next step is setting our
        host up as a KVM hypervisor.
      </p>

      <p><b>Note:</b> make sure your system is up to date with: </p>

      <code class="block"># yum upgrade</code>

      <p>before proceding.</p>

      <h3 id="install-kvm">Install KVM</h3>

      <p>
        This is simple enough if you know what packages to grab:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># yum install qemu-kvm libvirt libvirt-python \
libguestfs-tools virt-install</code>

      <p>
        Next we have to start the libvirtd service, and "enable" it so it starts
        on boot.
      </p>

      <code class="block"># systemctl enable libvirtd
# systemctl start libvirtd</code>

      <p>
        We want our virtual machines to be able to talk to real machines outside
        their virtual network, so we need to set up a network bridge for them.
        By default KVM sets up a 192.168.122.0/24 private network for VMs, which
        can be seen with <code>virsh net-dumpxml default</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        To set up our brige, we'll have to edit a config script for our physical
        LAN interface. You can find the name of it with <code>ifconfig</code>
        (you might need to <code>yum install net-tools</code> if you don't if
        <code>ifconfig</code>). My interface is called <code>em1</code>, but
        yours might be different.
      </p>

      <code class="block"># vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<i>em1</i></code>

      <p>
        Note: your script might not be named exactly the same way, just find the
        one with your interface in the name. To this file we just have to add:
      </p>

      <code class="block">BRIDGE=br0</code>

      <p>
        to the bottom. Save and close it. Next we create a config file for the
        bridge, in <code>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-br0</code>. Put
        this in that file:
      </p>

      <code class="block">DEVICE="br0"
BOOTPROTO="dhcp"
IPV6INIT="yes"
IPV6_AUTOCONF="yes"
ONBOOT="yes"
TYPE="Bridge"
DELAY="0"</code>

      <p>
        Restart the networking service and we'll be good to go:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># systemctl restart NetworkManager</code>

      <p>
        You can verify that everything worked by running 
        <code>brctl show</code>. You should see a bridge named <code>br0</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We could start creating VMs now, but first we want to install Foreman to
        automate a lot of the work associated with that.
      </p>

      <h3 id="install-foreman">Install Foreman</h3>

      <p>
        Foreman is a big confusing piece of software that includes a lot of
        moving parts, but it will make our lives easier in the future when we
        have a fleet of VMs running different services and want to be able to
        create more on the fly without any direct interaction.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/foreman-architecture.png">
          <img src="images/foreman-architecture.png" alt="Chart of Foreman's
                  various services">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The Foreman installer uses Puppet to install Foreman, so first we need
        to install Puppet:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># yum install https://yum.puppetlabs.com/puppet5/puppet5-release-el-7.noarch.rpm</code>

      <p>
        Then, enable the Etra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) and Foreman
        repos:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># yum install http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
# yum install https://yum.theforeman.org/releases/1.21/el7/x86_64/foreman-release.rpm</code>

      <p>
        Download the installer:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># yum install foreman-installer</code>

      <p>
        Before we run the installer, we have to make sure we have our
        Fully-Qualified Domain Name set up correctly. The FQDN includes the
        machine's hostname and an internet domain that points to it. For
        example, if my server is named <code>steve</code>, the FQDN could be
        <code>steve.example.com</code>. To update the hostname, run:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># hostnamectl set-hostname <i>steve</i></code>

      <p>
        Then edit <code>/etc/hosts</code>. Add a line to it that looks like
        this:
      </p>

      <code class="block">1.2.3.4 hostname.example.com hostname</code>

      <p>
        Make sure you replace 1.2.3.4 with the computer's real internal IP
        address though.
      </p>

      <p>
        With that done, we can run the installer.
      </p>

      <code class="block"># foreman-installer</code>

      <p>When it's finished you should get a block of text like this:</p>

      <code class="block">Success!
* Foreman is running at https://hostname.example.com
    Initial credentials are admin / aUaMiCRtLFXikhAF
* Foreman Proxy is running at https://hostname.example.com:8443
* Puppetmaster is running at port 8140
The full log is at /var/log/foreman-installer/foreman.log</code>

      <p>
        If you can't reach the web interface at the given address, make sure the
        correct ports are open on your server:
      </p>

      <code class="block"># firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port 80/tcp --permanent</code>

      <p>Repeat for each needed port.</p>

      <p>
        Now, if you log in to the Foreman web interface with the credentials you
        received from foreman-installer, you should be able to go to the Hosts
        tab and see your Foreman host. You should take this opportunity to set a
        new, secure password.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that we have the host machine configured and set up, that's enough
        for today. Next time we'll get into provisioning our virtual machines
        and setting up fun stuff like LDAP and DHCP.
      </p>
