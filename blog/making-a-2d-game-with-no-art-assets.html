      <h1 class="title">Making a 2D game with no art assets</h1>

      <p>
        In my <a href="designing-an-extensible-power-up-system">last blog
        post</a> I wrote about the game I'm working on with two of my friends.
        It now officially has a name, 
        <a href="https://afterlightcaves.com">Afterlight Caves</a>, and we're
        going to be showing it off at the WPI booth at
        <a href="https://east.paxsite.com/">PAX East</a>, February 27 through
        March 1 2020. In this post I'll talk about how three computer science
        majors with no artistic ability between them were able to make a decent
        looking game.
      </p>

        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The game's graphics system is powered by the 
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">JavaScript Canvas API</a>,
        which allows you to draw simple lines, circles, and rectangles onto an
        HTML canvas. Though simple, this API is deceptively powerful, and
        combining its various features allowed us to make some cool-looking
        effects.
      </p>

      <h2 id="simple-particles">Simple particles</h2>

      <p>
        Good looking particles add a lot of excitement and motion to a game, and
        they can be surprisingly simple to make. In our physics system, all
        entities have velocity, acceleration, and drag. Using these, we can
        create simple line-based particles very easily.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/afterlight-caves-2.png">
          <img src="images/th_afterlight-caves-2.png" alt="Screenshot of Afterlight Caves">
        </a>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Each particle has a lifetime, after which it is automatically removed
        from the world, an initially high velocity, and high drag. It's drawn as
        a line with length as a function of its velocity, so it naturally
        shortens as it slows down until it is removed. This creates a nice
        spark-like effect that is computationally cheap and snappy.
      </p>

      <h2 id="glow-effect">Glow effect</h2>

      <p>
        We tried to give Afterlight Caves a glowing, neon look.
