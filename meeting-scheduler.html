			<p>
			This project was done for CS 3733: Software Engineering. It was completed
			by a <a href="#team">team</a> of four students in about three weeks. The
			goal was to create a fully functional web application, including a public
			API, HTML/CSS/JavaScript front-end, and MySQL database. We used Amazon Web
			Services for the back-end and Angular for the front-end. The finished
			project's code can be seen at 
			<a href="https://github.com/jojonium/CS-3733" target="_blank">GitHub</a>,
			or it can be seen in action on 
			<a href="https://algol.petitti.org" target="_blank">our website</a>.
			</p>
	
			<p>
			The actual application is designed to allow users to set up a meeting
			schedule and send it to others, so that they can request meetings are
			particular times with the organizer.
			</p>

			<h3>Organizers</h3>

			<p>
			Organizers can specify a starting and ending date for their schedule, as
			well as a daily starting time and ending time. They can also select a
			preferred meeting length, from ten minutes to an hour. Organizers can open
			or close specific time slots, as well as all time slots at a particular
			time or on a particular day. If a time slot is closed, participants can
			not schedule a meeting for that time.
			</p>

			<p>
			Once an organizer has created a schedule, she is given a schedule ID and a
			secret code. The schedule ID can be given to participants, or shared as a
			URL such as 
			<span class="code">https://cs3733.com/schedule/<i>8bDj38</i></span>. The
			secret code is for the organizer to use if she wants to edit the schedule
			in the future. For example, she could extend the start or end dates or
			close particular time slots. The organizer can also use the secret code to
			see the names of all participants and when their meetings are scheduled
			for.
			</p>

			</figure>

			<h3>Participants</h3>

			<p>
			A participant can access a schedule by using its schedule ID. From here,
			he can request a meeting on a particular time and date, as long as the
			time slot is open and no other participant has requested a meeting at that
			same time. Participants are given a secret code when they request a
			meeting.
			</p>
			
			<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
			
			<p>
			Our team had one week to plan out the project, including designing the API
			using Swagger, drawing up UML diagrams, and writing out use cases. Then,
			from November 26 to December 14, 2018 we worked at a feverish pace to
			complete the entire project.
			</p>

			<h3>Back-End</h3>

			<p>
			The back-end of the project was done in AWS. API requests are processed by
			an AWS API gateway, then passed along to a relevant lambda function. These
			lambda functions were written in Java using the Entity-Boundary-Controller
			design scheme. The lambda functions parse the incoming JSON data into Java
			objects, then completes the requested action. They connect to the
			database, a MySQL instance running in AWS RDS, through JDBC.

			</figure>

			<h3>Front-End</h3>

			<p>
			The front-end was done in Google's Angular framework, using Google's
			material design elements and guidelines. Angular applications are written
			in TypeScript, a superscript of JavaScript that compiles to plain
			JavaScript. The front-end ended up being a miniature
			Entity-Boundary-Controller project, with TypeScript object entities,
			HTML/CSS boundaries, and TypeScript controllers that make the API calls.
			</p>

			<h2 id="team">Team</h2>

			<p>
			The class was divided into groups of four students, and each group was
			given a team name based on the names of stars. I was already friends with
			the three other group members I worked with before the class, so it was
			easy for me to find a group. Since our team was the first to sign up, we
			got the "A" star name, Algol.

					<h2>Joseph Petitti</h2>

					<p>
					Joseph Petitti was the fearless leader of Team Algol. He wrote the
					entire front-end in TypeScript for Google's Angular framework, set up
					much of the AWS back-end, designed and deployed the API, and spent far
					too many late nights debugging and testing.

					<h2>Justin Cheng</h2>

					<p>
					Justin Cheng set up the relational database for the project in AWS,
					wrote the database access objects, and wrote and tested several of the
					lambda functions. He was our database expert and wrote all the SQL
					statements and queries necessary for this web app to work.

					Matt Hagan was responsible for getting the initial AWS storage,

					being the EBC Controller lead for this project, working primarily with
					the Lambdas to ensure that the boundary and entity control flow ran
					smoothly.

					Andrew Levy designed the Algol team logo, as well as some of the HTML

					functions. Also, Andy wanted everyone to know that he has hamsters.
