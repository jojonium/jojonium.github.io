			<h2>Human Computer Interaction</h2>
			<p>Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is the intersection of computer science and design. It uses aspects of art, science, and engineering to build computer systems that are powerful, intuitive, and pleasing to use. In CS 3041, I explored the basics of HCI through six design sprints that included everything from accessibility for the elderly to virtual reality game design.</p>

			</figure>
			
			<p>The class has helped me learn a lot about HCI in particular, but also about the design process in general. Each successive design sprint gave fewer specifics and more freedom, allowing gradually guiding students to find what design steps work best for them. I found these main points to be the most important across each project:</p>
			
			<h2>1. Brainstorming for the right solution</h2>
			
			<figure class="float right">
				<img src="images/double-diamond.png" alt="Diagram of the Double-Diamond model of design"></img>
				<figcaption>The Double-Diamond Model of Design</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<p>In Don Norman's "<a target="_blank" href="https://cs3041-18d.github.io/docs/reading/DesignThinking_DonNorman.pdf">The Design of Everyday Things</a>," the the first phase of the "Double-Diamond" model of design is actually finding the right <i>problem</i>. For the design sprints in CS 3041, we were usually given a clear problem to solve, allowing us to often skip this step. (However, in some of the later design sprints brainstorming for the right problem was necessary).</p>
			
			<p>For most of the projects, my design process began with brainstorming. As soon as the groups were assigned, I would meet with them and begin talking about what we wanted our solution to look like. In this step, group members would throw around ideas without concern for feasibility or practicality. The goal of brainstorming is simply to generate as many ideas as possible, in the hopes of finding one that will work.</p>
			
			<p>Often it was useful to make a quick sketch of an idea on paper, to visualize what it would look like. My groups would generate several pages worth of rough idea sketches, like the one shown below:</p>
			
			<figure class="full-width" style="width: 60%; margin: 0 auto;">
                <img src="images/billionaires-brainstorming.jpg" alt="Brainstorming document for Design for Understanding"></img>
                <figcaption>One of many brainstorming documents for <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@ilanazeldin/design-for-understanding-39975b05bcea">Design for Understanding</a></figcaption>
            </figure>
			
			<p>The final product rarely ends up looking like the brainstorming sketches, but it's an important place to start.</p>
			
			<p>I also found that this step is often the hardest. As a computer science major, I'm good at strictly-defined constraints, and clear problem definitions. Being creative and coming up with new types of interactions, new visualizations, and entirely new constraints and problems is difficult for me. Fortunately, brainstorming in group settings has made the process much easier for me.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Do background research</h2>
            
			<figure style="width: 29%" class="float left">
                <img style="padding: 0 0 10px 0;" src="images/medicare-font-size.png" alt="Font size selector from medicare.gov website"></img>
                <img src="images/design-for-others-homepage.png" alt="Final homepage design from Design for Others"></img>
                <figcaption>I reused the "change font size" button from medicare.gov (top) in our Design for Others site (bottom).</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>Find out what people actually want. There's no point in designing something that no one will want to use. As we learned in the <a target="_blank" href="https://cs3041-18d.github.io/docs/schedule.html#tue-313--need-finding--task-analysis">many need finding readings</a>, finding out what users want is important. Sending out surveys, asking classmates and friends, and researching how similar projects have been done were all techniques I used for background research.</p>
			
			<p>For <a href="https://medium.com/@tarrasque9/design-for-others-design-document-898e1c398f55" target="_blank">Design for Others</a>, my team was tasked with redesigning the Worcester Public Library's website for mobile, specifically for an elderly (70+ years old) audience. My team created a <a target="_blank" href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/boards/VK3KOKVQBX4/">Mood Board</a> on Invision as a respository for ideas and images from other sites relevant to our project. As a part of my research, I saw what features other websites designed for elderly users did to be more accessible.</p>
			
			<p>One of the most useful features we included in our final site design was a button to make the font size bigger or smaller. From talking to elderly relatives about their experiences with mobile sites, I discovered that they often have trouble reading the text because it is too small. I looked at some other websites aimed at elderly users to see how they addressed this problem. I found that <a target="_blank" href="www.medicare.gov">medicare.gov</a>, has buttons on the top of the page to change the font size. I brought this idea to my group and we decided to implement it in our design.</p>
			
            <p>In our demo day feedback, the option to change font sizes was one of the most admired features, and we wou never have thought of it if not for the background research I did. It pays to do research.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Test the product thoroughly</h2>
            
            <p>I found from experience that testing the project before sending it to users is absolutely vital. Firstly, as with any computer science project the designs I made for the CS 3041 project were full of bugs and unintended side effects. Even though the code doesn't need to be completely robust for this class, if a program crashes during user testing it's impossible to get useful information.</p>
            
            <p>In <a href="https://medium.com/@droydstix/college-relationship-chatbot-danny-22b8c3599553">Design for Tension</a>, my group mapped out all the response path of our chatbot in a flowchart (see below), and then it was my job to make a program that followed the flowchart.
            
            <figure class="full width">
                <img src="images/tension-flowchart.png" alt="The response flowchart for my Design for Tension chatbot">
                <figcaption style="margin: 5px 0 0 0;">The final response flowchart for my team's Design for Tension chatbot was quite complicated</figcaption>
            </figure>
            
            <p>The chatbot involves many possible branching conversation paths, and I needed to test every one of them before we sent the program to users for testing. I went through each path several times with several different input phrases to make sure everything worked. While this was a lot of work, it was worth it. Every user test where the product breaks is a wasted user test.</p>
            
            <h2>4. User Testing</h2>
            
			<p>In my experience, user testing is perhaps the most important and useful point of the design process. Letting other people use the project, and seeing how they interact with it, what problems they face, and what new questions they raise is incredibly important to any project. Users often asked about things I hadn't even considered in the design process prior to that point.</p>
			
			<figure class="float right">
                <img src="images/user-testing.jpg" alt="A user testing our Design for Another World project on demo day">
                <figcaption><a href="https://medium.com/@erickmoo/design-for-another-world-755b3e238d0e" target="_blank">Design for Another World</a> demo day</figcaption>
            </figure>
			
			<p>Before demo day, I would let my friends and roommates test out my prototypes, and write down any problems they had, things they liked, and questions that came up. This feedback was very helpful in the final iterations of the projects before presenting them.</p>
			
			<p>Demo day was another excellent place to get feedback from user testing. For the last three design sprints, I brought a camera to film my classmates using the projects. The videos allowed my team to look back about how users reacted while testing the prototypes, and have a perfect record of their feedback.</p>
			
            <p style="text-align: center; padding: 40px 0">Here are my demo day videos (I won't embed them because of YouTube's tracking policy):</br>
			<a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/xYBTzRrbbLI">Design for Tension</a> | <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/4DVgaUKoh4s">Design for Wellbeing</a> | <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/JWe_02rH6pM">Design for Another World</a></p>
			
			<p>During my first round of testing for <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@hayley.boigenzahn/design-for-wellbeing-394db54501da">Design for Wellbeing</a>, I discovered that users were confused by the loading period while the Affectiva program recognized their face. I added a loading screen to the <a target="_blank" href="http://josephpetitti.com/hci-project5">final version</a> to mitigate this confusion. In this way, user testing can be a powerful tool for finding out what features would be most useful to end users, even if they wouldn't be obvious from the designer's perspective.</p>
			
			<p>User testing is easier in some mediums than others. For example, having a friend look at a mobile site layout for Design for Others and provide feedback can be done in a matter of seconds, but observing a user run through a full conversation with my Design for Tension chatbot, or play through a whole VR game for Design for Another World is a longer commitment. Further, once a person has seen one version of a design, it will bias their opinion of later versions. This too has varying impact depending on the medium. Both of these effects must be taken into consideration when conducting user testing.</p>

			</figure>
			
			<h2>5. Revise and iterate</h2>
			
			<p>The final step in my design process, "revise and iterate," can be the longest or shortest step depending on the time constraints of the project. It goes hand in hand with user testing and other types of testing. After receiving feedback, you must adjust and alter the project to make it better. Fix any problems that came up in testing, add new features requested by users, and generally make the product better.</p>
			
			<p>After each revision, the prototype needs to be tested again. And after those tests, you can revise again based on the new feedback. And with these revisions the process repeats.</p>
			
			<p>When my projects finished with days to spare, we could go through four or five rounds of revision before demo day. In <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@tarrasque9/design-for-others-design-document-898e1c398f55">Design for Others</a> my group was able to go through many revisions, and end up with a very clean and polished final product. However, for other design sprints when time is tight we sometimes only had time for one or two iterations.</p>
			
			<p>Nevertheless, revision and iteration is what turns a good idea into a polished product. With each new round the interactions become smoother, the design becomes more pleasant, and the program becomes more robust.</p>

			</figure>
			
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			
			<p>In every design sprint we were limited by time and resources. We had only around a week, and a $0 budget to create innovative and interesting designs. The final products never looked like the original ideas. But that's okay, because the point of HCI is not to create a perfect design, but to learn about and move towards better designs.</p>
			
			<p>The design process I learned here is a valuable tool that can be applied to any engineering project, not just in the realm of HCI or even computer science. CS 3041 taught me how to think with human users in mind, how to design in a wide variety of mediums for a wide assortment of goals, how to work with small groups on focused projects, and how to be creative. Though it was challenging often, and frustrating at times, HCI is an important part of any computer scientist's career, and a valuable topic to know and understand.</p>

			<h2>About Me</h2>
			
			<p>I have a wide range of interests. I love learning about technology, hiking and camping, watching and reviewing movies, and playing roleplaying and video games.</p>
			
			<p>Technology fascinates me. I am always excited to learn more about computer science, and information-technology. In both my academic and personal life, I try to teach myself as much as I can about it. <a href="this-website">This website</a> is a perfect example of that.</p>
			
			<p>As an Eagle Scout, I've been an avid outdoorsman for years. Despite going to school in Massachusetts, perhaps the worst state for outdoor activities, I continue to go backpacking, hiking, and camping whenever I can. The picture below is a friend and me on top of Mount Colden in New York.</p>
