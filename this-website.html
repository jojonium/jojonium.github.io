      <h2 id="about">About</h2>

      <p>
        This website is written almost entirely in HTML and CSS. The point of
        this website is to help teach myself web design, and make a personal
        website that looks good enough to show off to employers and friends. The
        design of the site has evolved over several months as I learned of new
        ways to do things and thought of more elements that would look cool. I
        also sometimes use the site to host pieces of projects for classes. To
        see the history of changes I've made to the site, check out my
        <a href="https://github.com/jojonium/josephpetitti.com">GitHub</a>
        page.
      </p>

      <p>
        The HTML and CSS is written entirely from scratch by myself, without any
        website-building tool or service. The only program I use is a simple
        text editor (<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org">Notepad++</a> on
        Windows and <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> on GNU/Linux), and
        Chomiums's developer tools. The site was originally hosted using 
        <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>, but in July 2018 I
        switched to self hosting it on a server I built and set up (see
        <a href="#self-hosting">below</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, one of the issues I've run into is that I don't know what
        to actually write!  It turns out that creating good-looking pages is a
        lot easier than coming up with interesting content to put on them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, I have discovered that CSS is annoying. Now I'm pretty competent
        with it, but it took many frustrating hours to learn everything. For
        example, these headers look really cool, but it took a <i>very</i> long
        time to figure out how to position everything properly.
      </p>

      <canvas width="400" height="400" id="seen-canvas" style="float: right;">

      <script type="text/coffeescript" id="code">
        width  = 400
        height = 400

        # Create sphere shape with randomly colored surfaces
        shape = seen.Shapes.sphere(2).scale(height * 0.4)
        seen.Colors.randomSurfaces2(shape)

        # Create scene and add shape to model
        scene = new seen.Scene
          model    : seen.Models.default().add(shape)
          viewport : seen.Viewports.center(width, height)

        # Create render context from canvas
        context = seen.Context('seen-canvas', scene).render()

        # Slowly rotate sphere
        context.animate()
          .onBefore((t, dt) -> shape.rotx(dt*1e-4).roty(0.7*dt*1e-4))
          .start()

        # Enable drag-to-rotate on the canvas
        dragger = new seen.Drag('seen-canvas', {inertia : true})
        dragger.on('drag.rotate', (e) ->
          xform = seen.Quaternion.xyToTransform(e.offsetRelative...)
          shape.transform(xform)
          context.render()
        )
      </script>

      <h2 id="seen.js">seen.js</h2>

      <p>
        However, it's not all HTML and CSS. The visualization on the
        <a href="index">front page</a> was created using
        <a href="http://seenjs.io">seen.js</a>, a JavaScript framework for
        rendering 3D scenes into an SVG or HTML5 canvas. The scenes are written
        in <a href="http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a>, a cleaner and
        simpler language that compiles into JavaScript.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="projects">projects</a> and <a href="other">other</a> pages
        contain simple seen.js canvases as eye candy to make these pages more
        visually appealing. Making these seen.js scenes also helped me learn
        JavaScript in 2018.

      </svg>

      <p>
        My personal logo, shown on the left, is a design I came up with as a
        kid. The color scheme is completely arbitrary (being color blind and
        knowing nothing about graphic design makes it better to just pick colors
        out of a hat than try to figure out what matches what).
      </p>

      <p>
        I made the original digital version of the logo years ago in Microsoft
        PowerPoint and exported it as a PNG. However, at some point I lost the
        original file. Because the PNG was small and didn't scale very well I
        decided to remake the logo as an
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">
          SVG</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Still knowing nothing about graphic design, I painstakingly wrote the
        code for the SVG by hand, and it is reproduced in all its glory
        below:
      </p>

      <h2 id="self-hosting">Self Hosting</h2>

      <p>
        In July of 2018 I decided to stop relying on Github Pages and host the
        website on my own server.  This decision came for several reasons.
        GitHub Pages was a nice service, but it doesn't have good support for
        HTTPS. Also, if I ever want my website to be anything but static HTML
        pages and client-side scripts GitHub Pages won't work for my needs any
        more. Plus, I had an old computer lying around and a strong desire to
        learn about servers and networking.
      </p>

      <figure class="float right">
        <a href="images/server.jpg">
          <img src="images/th_server.jpg" alt="My server setup">
        </a>
        <figcaption>My personal data center/fire hazard</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        First, I installed <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/server">Ubuntu
        Server</a> 18.04 GNU/Linux on the server, and set up an SSH connection
        from my main desktop. From there, I installed
        <a href="https://nginx.org">nginx</a> and used it to configure a reverse
        proxy so I could have multiple servers running on the same machine. I
        acquired an SSL certificate from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's
        Encrypt</a>, and set an nginx rule to rewrite all HTTP requests to
        HTTPS. With this and other security measures in place, I cloned the
        website from GitHub and changed the A records in my domain name
        registrar to point to the server, and now my little server is
        broadcasting to the whole world. I even added a cron job to the server
        to automatically pull from GitHub every ten minutes to keep the site up
        to date.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having little GNU/Linux, and even less command line experience before
        hand, this process was slow, confusing, and frustrating at times. Almost
        everything that could go wrong while setting up nginx did go wrong. But
        it definitely taught me a lot about networking, GNU/Linux, and web
        development.

      <h2 id="new-design">New Design</h2>

      <p>
        In April 2019, about a year after I first started working on the
        website, I decided to revamp it with a fresh design. The original design
        wasn't responsive on mobile, and my <span class="code">style.css</span>
        was full of accumulated cruft from when I was first learning web design.
        I wanted a fresh start to show off my newfound mastery of flexboxes,
        transition animations, and responsive design.
      </p>

      <figure class="full-width">
        <a href="images/old-design.png">
          <img src="images/th_old-design.png" alt="Old index page">
        </a>
        <figcaption>
          The original design of the index page
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        This design was good enough (and actually helped me get a job), but the
        accumulation of janky CSS hacks over a year made it difficult to add to
        it consistently. The navigation bar also relied on hover states, which
        made it unusable on mobile. Instead of hacking together a fix for the
        existing 500-line stylesheet I decided to start over.
      </p>

      <h3 id="design-principles">Design Principles</h3>

      <p>
        I designed the new website style with these principles in mind:
      </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Simplicity</b>: the site should be simple and easy to read, with a
            minimal number of unique elements and different colors
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Mobile compatibility</b>: everything should look good and be usable
          on mobile, but the desktop experience should not be sacrificed for
          this
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Extensibility</b>: It should be easy for me to add new elements and
          different kinds of pages in the future
        </li>
      </ol>
